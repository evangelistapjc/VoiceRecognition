# Voice Recognition (Senior Design Project)

Demo IFE Voice Recognition Website 

In this repository, I created a sample IFE chatbot powered by a Machine Learning AI that responds with unique answers based on the questions/statements that you provide via voice recognition! This chat has limited answers and responses, but continues to learn as you train the chatbot AI.

# Instructions

To begin, click on the "Voice" button, and say any sentence out loud, which would then print out onto the chatbot textbox. Afterwards, hit submit, and your message will be relayed to the sampled chatbot. After a second, the AI will choose a unique response corresponding to your message.

You will then be responsible with deciding whether or not the answer to the chatbot AI was correct or not, in which two buttons will appear under the "Reinforcement Area". If the chatbot AI response was good and you click "Yes", all is well and you can continue responding. However, if you choose "no", the screen will prompt you to enter a better and more appropriate response by the chatbot AI. Once you finish, you hit submit, and you will be able to continue speaking with the chatbot.

This Project was developed as my Senior Design Group Project in collaboration with Thales Group. No code provided by their company was published onto this site, and all respective code was developed and created by myself. Additionally, this project encompassed a research portion that required us to determine whether Voice Recognition was even feasible in an Airplane cabin. Tests were conducted in varying levels of sound, in addition to recording key phrases that a passsenger might say or do on an airplane.
